# www.frost.cx
This is the git repository for my personal website, accessible [here](http://www.frost.cx).
This allows for version controlled changes to the site, as well as automatic syncing to the server.

I have since moved the site to a different repo [here](https://github.com/Fraetor/fraetor.github.io) so that is is hosted on GitHub pages.
